        <h4>Establishing Principled Design Guidelines for Before/After Satellite Image Comparisons in Human Rights Advocacy</h4>
        
        <p>We present a principled series of design guidelines that aim to improve the design of before/after satellite image comparisons (B/A) used to communicate human rights  research. Based on the analysis of a large set of B/A designs and interviews with three leading experts on the use of satellite imagery in the field of HR, we introduce a list of thirteen typical elements of the satellite image, which we structure in a design space to best inform the design of individual satellite images. We then present a set of twelve viewer-driven requirements for comparison, from which we derive seven design principles for avoiding major problems in B/A. Next, we describe a practical set of quality metrics for evaluating the implementation of our guidelines. Finally, we explain the de- sign of a browser-based, principled graphic editor for designing B/A, which integrates our design guidelines.</p>

        <h4><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2474695">The Persuasive Power of Data Visualization</a></h4>

        <p>Data visualization has been used extensively to inform users. However, little research has been done to examine the effects of data visualization in inﬂuencing users or in making a message more persuasive. In this study, we present experimental research to ﬁll this gap and present an evidence-based analysis of persuasive visualization. We built on persuasion research from psychology and user interfaces literature in order to explore the persuasive effects of visualization. In this experimental study we define the circumstances under which data visualization can make a message more persuasive, propose hypotheses, and perform quantitative and qualitative analyses on studies conducted to test these hypotheses. We compare visual treatments with data presented through barcharts and linecharts on the one hand, treatments with data presented through tables on the other, and then evaluate their persuasiveness. The ﬁndings represent a ﬁrst step in exploring the effectiveness of persuasive visualization.</p>

        <h4><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2566968">How Deceptive are Deceptive Visualizations?: An Empirical Analysis of Common Distortion Techniques</a></h4>

        <p>In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of deceptive visualizations. We start with an in-depth analysis of what deception means in the context of data visualization, and categorize deceptive visualizations based on the type of deception they lead to. We identify popular distortion techniques and the type of visualizations those distortions can be applied to, and formalize why deception occurs with those distortions. We create four deceptive visualizations using the selected distortion techniques, and run a crowdsourced user study to identify the deceptiveness of those visualizations. We then present the findings of our study and show how deceptive each of these visual distortion techniques are, and for what kind of questions the misinterpretation occurs. We also analyze individual differences among participants and present the effect of some of those variables on participants’ responses. This paper presents a first step in empirically studying deceptive visualizations, and will pave the way for more research in this direction.</p>
